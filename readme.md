# Iris Recognition and Periocular Recognition

## For streamlit demostration

Iris Recognition:

- streamlit run 'user directory/Daugman_demo.py'

Periocular Recognition:

- streamlit run 'user directory/Peri_demo.py'

## For jupyter notebook source code

Iris Recognition:

- Use Daugman_final.ipynb

Periocular Recognition:

- Use peri_cnn.ipynb
- For periocular recognition use the Load Image and Transfer learning and SVM code for maximum accuracy
